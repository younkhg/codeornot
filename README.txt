#   idea
    -   vim color scheme that should work with any terminal color scheme that satisfies proposed assumption
    -   distinguishes only three elements
        -   code
        -   constants (number, string, ...)
        -   comments

#   assumption
    -   0 is foreground
    -   15 is background
    -   characters with dark colors stands out on top of light color backgrounds

#   term colors and names
    dark  | 0:black 1:red 2:green 3:yellow 4:blue 5:magenta 6:cyan 7:white
    light | 8:      9:   10:     11:      12:    13:       14:    15:
